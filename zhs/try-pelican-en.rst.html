It seems in one night

and Octopress_ Blog.
Like everyone posted in their blogs, Static Blog is indeed more convenient than traditional 
Blog systems such as WordPress. I have been wanting my own Octopress_ since then.

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">_Octopress:</span> http://octopress.org/

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">_Pelican:</span> http://pelican.notmyidea.org/en/latest/

<span class="gh">But it seems that Octopress_ isn&#39;t for me</span>
<span class="gh">+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</span>

At first I was confused  by <span class="s">`Setup Steps of Octopress </span><span class="si">&lt;http://octopress.org/docs/setup/&gt;</span><span class="s">`_</span> .  What is this RVM_ thing? 
And what is that rbenv_ thing? It seems  the high pace of Ruby community has beyond my imagination to a degree that 
they need a version manager to ensure the compatibility of different versions of Ruby. Althrough the same compatibility  
issue also troubles Python community <span class="s">[#]_</span> , but at least Python don&#39;t need a version manager (yet) to control this mass <span class="s">[#]_</span> .

Real problem for me is that I haven&#39;t yet a Linux box that I can play around freely. (I really want one ... ) Both RVM_ and 
rbenv_ needs to run on Unix/Linux/MacOSX. One can not be a geek if he use Windows ? (Maybe it&#39;s true...)

Remaining problem is the battle between Ruby and Python campaign.  I haven&#39;t tried Markdown_ , and I rather like ReST_ . 
It seems that both sides depend on Pygments_ as code block highlighter so  Rubyists need Python environment anyway. 
I simply don&#39;t want to depend on any Ruby component. It is better when it is in pure Python, no C extensions so that I can 
debug into it and make minor modifications.

So I started searching for Static Blog Engine in Python on Github. The author of the great framework Flask_ , mitsuhiko_ , 
wrote a rstblog_ , but it&#39;s not well developed. Hyde_ seems to be complete enough, but it use MarkDown_ as its default markup 
language, and the design of its homepage is too fashion to be used as blog. Finally I found Pelican_ .

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">[#]</span> Such as the difference between Python 2.x and 3.x , and also difference in C-API of implementations of PyPy_ , CPython_ , Stackless_ , Cython_ .

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">[#]</span> Yes, we have easy_install_ and pip_ , but all these are package manager, running in a perticular Python implementation. Python implementation itself don&#39;t need a manager. Version issue of Python largely have been solved by lightweight converters such as 2to3.py_ and 3to2.py_ , you don&#39;t need to store multiple implementations of Python in your disk for different packages. Yes you can use  virtualenv_ if you need to preserve stablility but this is another story.

<span class="gh">Let it be Pelican_</span>
<span class="gh">++++++++++++++++++</span>

For my own use, Pelican_ offers me some advantages over Octopress_:

 <span class="m">#.</span> Implemented in <span class="ge">*pure Python*</span>. This means that I can use different implementation of Python other than CPython easily. I use PyPy_ myself.
 <span class="m">#.</span> Translation of multi-languages. The original author of Pelican_ is a France. This is unnecessory for most people, but I will post my blog mainly in three languages: English, Japanese and Chinese.
 <span class="m">#.</span> ReST_ . So that I can use the @auto-rst feature of Leo_ . And also I don&#39;t need to switch between my blog and documentation of my projects.

But it seems that Pelican_ was less contributed than Octopress_ . Some minor issues remains in latest version:

 <span class="m">#.</span> Support of pelican-import from WordPress for Chinese and Japanese articles are buggy.
 <span class="m">#.</span> Datetime format, timezone, and locale support for multi-language blogs are not so natural. <span class="ge">*I will work on this in these days*</span>
 <span class="m">#.</span> There are not so many templates compared to Octopress_ .
 <span class="m">#.</span> And less plugins .

I hope more people from Python community can contribute to this excellent project, then all these issues will be fixed soon.

<span class="gh">My settings</span>
<span class="gh">+++++++++++</span>

To install Pelican_ is simple:

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="ow">code-block</span><span class="p">::</span> <span class="k">console</span>

    <span class="gp">$</span> pip install pelican

Write posts in ReST_ , with <span class="s">``rst``</span> extensions, and put them in <span class="s">``pages``</span> folder. (Re)Build all pages is simply:

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="ow">code-block</span><span class="p">::</span> <span class="k">console</span>

    <span class="gp">$</span> pelican -s settings.py
    <span class="go"></span>
Push to Github:

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="ow">code-block</span><span class="p">::</span> <span class="k">console</span>

    <span class="gp">$</span> git commit -am <span class="s2">&quot;Commit message&quot;</span>
    <span class="gp">$</span> git push

And following is my <span class="s">``settings.py``</span>:
